  Stringillum is an interactive kinetic painting with audio-reactivity. Mouse click starts the sound and clears the canvas; mouse location affects the sound.  Fundamental design of the work is based on a custom object and its distribution on to  2-dimensional array structure. Aesthetically it aims to have sharp and gothic look which is provided by the curve arrays. The Usage of the such system creates a ligth efect which can be considered as an illusion. The motion design is layered into sub sections.
